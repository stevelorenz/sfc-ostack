# OpenStack-SFC Client Module #

A Python REST-client(single file module) for OpenStack
[networking-sfc](https://docs.openstack.org/networking-sfc/latest/) neutron extension.

The official documentation of this extension currently *only* provides command-line interface, which makes it difficult
to use this extension in a Python based project. This module implements a wrapper client for SFC(Service Function
    Chaining) operations based on provided REST APIs.

Programming Language: Python 3.5.2
